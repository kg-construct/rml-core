# Joins

A [=referencing object map=] allows using the subject generated by the [=subject map=] (`rml:SubjectMap`) of the referenced [=triples map=] (`rml:TriplesMap`).
Since the two [=triples maps=] may be based on different [=logical sources=] (`rml:LogicalSource`), this may require a [=join=] between the [=logical sources=]. This is not restricted to 1:1 joins.

## Referencing Object Map

A <dfn>referencing object map</dfn> (`rml:ReferencingObjectMap`) is represented by a resource that MUST have:

* exactly one [=parent triples map=] (`rml:parentTriplesMap`) property,
  whose value MUST be a [=triples map=], known as the referencing object map's <dfn>parent triples map</dfn>.
* one or more join condition (`rml:joinCondition`) properties, whose values MUST be [=join conditions=].

The [=referencing object map=] causes the generation of new [=object=] which is constructed with the [=subject=] generated by evaluating the [=parent triples map=].

<aside class="example" id="example-referencing-object-map" title="Usage of referencing object map">

This example shows a [=referencing object map=] as part of a [=predicate-object map=] in a [=triples map=] mapping the `ex:hasThumbnail` [=property=] of and `ex:Image` class.
Since the source data for the thumbnail is part of the same [=logical iteration=] as for the image, the [=logical source=] is [=effectively equal=] to the [=logical source=] of the [=parent triples map=], and no [=join condition=] is needed.

## Join Condition

A <dfn data-lt="join">join condition</dfn> is represented by a resource that has exactly one value for each of the following two properties:

* a child map (`rml:childMap`) property, whose value is a [=child map=].<br> A <dfn>child map</dfn> (`rml:ChildMap`) is an [=expression map=] which MUST be evaluated against the [=logical source=] of the [=triples map=] that contains the [=referencing object map=], i.e. the <>current [=triples map=], or it should have a [=constant value=].

* a parent map (`rml:parentMap`) property, whose value is a [=parent map=].<br> A <dfn>parent map</dfn> (`rml:ParentMap`) is an [=expression map=], which MUST be evaluated against the [=logical source=] of the [=referencing object map=]'s [=parent triples map=], i.e. the referenced [=triples map=], or it should have a [=constant value=].

If the the [=logical source=] of the [=triples map=] that contains the [=referencing object map=] and the [=logical source=] of the [=referencing object map=]'s [=parent triples map=] are not [=effectively equal=], then the referencing object map MUST have one or more [=join conditions=].

A [=join condition=] is satisfied if the result of evaluating the [=child map=] against the [=logical source=] of the current [=triples map=] is equal to the result of evaluating the [=parent map=] against the [=logical source=] of the referenced [=triples map=].

If a [=referencing object map=] has multiple [=join conditions=], then all of them MUST be satisfied for the referencing object map to be evaluated.

A [=mapping component=] is <dfn>effectively equal</dfn> to another [=mapping component=] if they are identical, or if all their corresponding [=effective properties=] have the same values, recursively comparing values that are [=resources=] that have [=properties=] as well.

An <dfn>effective property</dfn> of a [=mapping component=] is a [=property=] that has an effect on the [=mapping process=].

<aside class="note">
The effective properties of a mapping component are the properties that are used in the mapping process, and are defined by this specification or other specifications that extend this specification.

This example shows a [=referencing object map=] as part of a [=predicate-object map=], where the [=logical sources=] of the two [=triples maps=] are not [=effectively equal=]. Therefore, a [=join condition=] is needed to join the two [=logical iterations=].

<#AlbumTriplesMap>
  rml:predicateObjectMap [
    rml:predicate ex:hasImage ;
    rml:objectMap [

      rml:joinCondition [
        rml:childMap [
          rml:reference "$.Images[*].ID" ;
        ] ;
        rml:parentMap [
          rml:reference "$.ID" ;
        ] ;

    ] ;

The following RDF triples are generated by the [=RML mapping=] above, since the first `ID` field in the `Images` array of the `album.json` input source is joined with the `ID` field in the `images.json` input source.

### Shortcuts for reference-valued child map and parent map

If the [=child map=] is a [=reference-valued expression map=], then the `rml:child` shortcut could be used.

Similarly, if the [=parent map=] is a [=reference-valued expression map=], then the `rml:parent` shortcut could be used.

Occurrences of these properties MUST be treated exactly as if the following triples were present in the [=mapping graph=] instead:

| Triple involving reference shortcut property | Replacement triples                      |
| :--------------------------------------------| :----------------------------------------|
| `?x rml:child ?y.`                           | `?x rml:childMap [ rml:reference ?y ].`  |
| `?x rml:parent ?y.`                          | `?x rml:parentMap [ rml:reference ?y ].` |
