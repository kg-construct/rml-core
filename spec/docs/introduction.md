# Base IRIs
The base IRI of the document is used to resolve relative IRIs in the RML document following the specification of the Turtle serialisaiton.

## Base IRI for mapping rules

The [=base IRI=] of the [=Triples Map=] is used in resolving relative IRIs produced by the R2RML mapping.


<pre class="ex-mapping nohighlight">
# Triples Map that generates "type" triples
<#TriplesMap>
    a rml:TriplesMap;
    rml:baseIri "http://example.com/" .
</pre>

The [=base IRI=] MUST be a valid IRI. It SHOULD NOT contain question mark (“?”) or hash (“#”) characters and SHOULD end in a slash (“/”) character.

To obtain an absolute IRI from a relative IRI, the term generation rules of RML use simple string concatenation, rather than the more complex algorithm for resolution of relative URIs defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC3986]. This ensures that the original database value can be reconstructed from the generated absolute IRI. Both algorithms are equivalent if all of the following are true:

    1. The base IRI does not contain question marks or hashes,
    2. the base IRI ends in a slash,
    3. the relative IRI does not start with a slash, and
    4. the relative IRI does not contain any “.” or “..” path segments.
