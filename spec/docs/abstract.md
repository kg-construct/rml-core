This document describes RML, a generic mapping language, based on and extending [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml). The RDF Mapping language (RML) is a mapping language defined to express customized mapping rules from heterogeneous data structures and serializations to the RDF [RDF-CONCEPTS](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/) data model. RML is defined as a superset of the W3C-standardized mapping language [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml), aiming to extend its applicability and broaden its scope, adding support for data in other structured formats. [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml) is the W3C standard to express customized mappings from relational databases to RDF. RML follows exactly the same syntax as R2RML; therefore, RML mappings are themselves [=RDF graphs=]. The present document describes the RML-Core language and its concepts through definitions and examples.
