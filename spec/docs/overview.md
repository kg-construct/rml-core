# RML Overview and Example

This section gives a brief overview of the RML mapping language, followed by a simple example of JSON documents with an RML mapping document and its output RDF. Further RML examples can be found in the [RML-core test-cases](http://w3id.org/rml/core/test-cases).

An [=RML mapping=] refers to [=logical sources=] to retrieve data from the [=input data source=].

Each [=logical source=] is mapped to RDF using a [=triples map=].
The [=triples map=] is a rule that maps each iteration in the [=logical source=]
to a number of [=RDF triples=].
The rule has two main parts:

 1. A [=subject map=] that generates the subject of all [=RDF triples=]
 that will be generated from a logical source iteration.
 The subjects often are [=IRIs=].
 2. Multiple [=predicate-object maps=] that
 in turn consist of [=predicate maps=] and [=object maps=]
 (or [=referencing object maps=]).

[=Triples=] are produced by combining the [=subject map=] with a [=predicate map=] and [=object map=], and applying these three to each [=logical iteration=]. For example, the complete rule for generating a set of [=triples=] might be:

Subjects: A template `http://data.example.com/image/{ID}` is used to generate subject [=IRIs=] from the `ID` name.
Predicates: The constant vocabulary [=IRI=] `ex:title` is used.
Objects: The value of the `Title` name is used to produce an [=RDF literal=].
 
By default, all [=RDF triples=] are in the [=default graph=] of the [=output dataset=].
A [=triples map=] can contain [=graph maps=] that
place some or all of the triples into [=named graphs=] instead. 

An overview of the [=RML vocabulary=] is shown in [[[#fig-rml-core-vocabulary]]]:
