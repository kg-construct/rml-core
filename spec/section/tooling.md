# RML Processors, Validators and Generators


### RML Processor

An <dfn>RML processor</dfn> is a system that, given an RML mapping and an input data source,
provides access to the [=output dataset=].

The process of generating the [=output dataset=] by an [=RML processor=] is called the <dfn data-lt="mapping process">RML mapping process</dfn>.

There are no constraints on the method of access to the [=output dataset=]
provided by a conforming [=RML processor=].
An [=RML processor=] MAY materialize the [=output dataset=] into a file,
or offer virtual access through an interface,
or offer any other means of providing access to the [=output dataset=].

An [=RML processor=] also has access to an execution environment consisting of:
* A [=logical source=]
* A [=base IRI=] 

How the [=logical source=] is accessed,
or how users are authenticated against the database,
is outside of the scope of this document.

#### Base IRI
A [=base IRI=] is used in resolving relative [=IRIs=] produced by the RML mapping. The [=base IRI=] MUST be 
defined within the mapping document for each [=Triples Map=] or as execution environment for the [=mapping document=]. 

<aside class="example" id="example-baseIRI-mappings" title="Base IRI example">
The following [=RML Mapping Document=] maps the album.json input source to [=RDF Triples=] with a base IRI.

<aside class="ex-mapping">

```turtle
# Triples Map that has a declared base IRI
<#TriplesMap> a rml:TriplesMap;
    rml:baseIRI <http://example.com/baseIRI/> ;
    rml:source [
      a rml:RelativePathSource ;
      rml:root rml:MappingDirectory ;
      rml:path "album.json" ;
    ] ;
    rml:iterator "$.Album" ;
    rml:referenceFormulation rml:JSONPath ;
  ] ;
  rml:subjectMap [
    rml:template "{$.ID}" ;
    rml:class ex:Album ;
  ] ;
  rml:predicateObjectMap [
    rml:predicate ex:title ;
    rml:objectMap [
      rml:reference "$.Title" ;
    ] ;
  ] .
```
</aside>

The following RDF triples are generated by the [=RML mapping=] above.

<aside class="ex-output">

```turtle
<http://example.com/baseIRI/43> a ex:Album .
<http://example.com/baseIRI/43> ex:title "City Views" .

```

<aside class="note">
The base IRI of the [=mapping document=] is used to resolve relative [=IRIs=] in the RML document following the specification of the Turtle serialisaiton.
</aside>

The [=base IRI=] MUST be a valid [=IRI=]. It SHOULD NOT contain question mark ("`?`") or hash ("`#`") characters and 
SHOULD end in a slash ("`/`") character.

<aside class="note">
To obtain an absolute [=IRI=] from a relative [=IRI=],
the term generation rules of RML use simple string concatenation,
rather than the more complex algorithm for resolution of [=relative URIs=].
This ensures that the original [=expression evaluation result=] can be reconstructed from the generated absolute [=IRI=].
Both algorithms are equivalent if all of the following are true:

1. The [=base IRI=] does not contain question marks or hashes,
2. the [=base IRI=] ends in a slash,
3. the relative [=IRI=] does not start with a slash, and
4. the relative [=IRI=] does not contain any “.” or “..” path segments.
</aside>

If no specific [=base IRI=] is provided and the [=mapping process=] needs to generate absolute [=IRIs=] from relative ones, 
the default base IRI to be used by the [=RML Processor=] MUST be http://example.org/.

### RML Validator

An <dfn>RML data validator</dfn> is a system that takes as its input
an [=RML mapping=], a [=base IRI=], and one or more [=data sources=],
and checks for the presence of [=data errors=].
A data validator MUST report any [=data errors=]
that are raised in the [=mapping process=].

An [=RML processor=] MAY include an [=RML data validator=], but this is not required.


## Data Errors

A <dfn>data error</dfn> is a condition of the data in the [=input data source=]
that would lead to the generation of an invalid [=RDF term=].
The following conditions give rise to data errors:

1. A [=term map=] with term type `rml:IRI` results in the generation of an invalid [=IRI=].
2. A [=term map=] whose [=natural RDF datatype=] is overridden with a specified [=datatype=]
produces an [=ill-typed literal=] (see [=datatype-override RDF literal=]).

When providing access to the [=output dataset=],
an [=RML processor=] MUST abort any operation
that requires inspecting or returning an [=RDF term=]
whose generation would give rise to a data error,
and report an error to the agent invoking the operation.
A conforming [=RML processor=] MAY, however,
allow other operations that do not require inspecting or returning these [=RDF terms=],
and thus MAY provide partial access to an [=output dataset=] that contains data errors.
Nevertheless, an [=RML processor=] SHOULD report data errors as early as possible.

The presence of data errors does not make an [=RML mapping=] non-conforming.

<aside class="note">
Data errors cannot generally be detected by analyzing the schema of the input data,
but only by scanning the data in the data source.
For large and rapidly changing databases, this can be impractical.
Therefore, [=RML processors=] are allowed to answer queries
that do not "touch" a data error,
and the behavior of such operations is well-defined. For the same reason,
the conformance of [=RML mappings=] is defined without regard for the presence of data errors.

[=RML data validators=] can be used to explicitly scan a [=data source=] for data errors.
