<dfn>n-ary Cartesian product</dfn>

Given set `𝑋₁`, `...`, `𝑋ₙ`, the [=n-ary Cartesian product=] over *n* sets `𝑋₁`, `...`, `𝑋ₙ`, denoted `𝑋₁ × ... × 𝑋ₙ`, is defined as the set of all ordered lists of *n* elements `(𝑥₁ , ... , 𝑥ₙ)` such that `𝑥ₙ` belongs to `𝑋ₙ`.<br>
For example, if `A = {1, 2}`, `B = {a, b, c}`, and `C = {Z}`, then the [=n-ary Cartesian product=]of A, B and C is `{(1, a, Z), (1, b, Z), (1, c, Z), (2, a, Z), (2, b, Z), (2, c, Z)}`.
